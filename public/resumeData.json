    "bio": "Hi there! I am Aryan! Wrote my first program when I was 13 (a shutdown virus) and since then I've been hacking and creating. I then started learning pentesting (before watching Mr. Robot :) and also did hack into the main computer of my school and into my college website (I am not a certified hacker though, but they have no proof of that so..:). During college, I made various interesting projects (like Stock Price Prediction, Face mask detection, etc.). Simultaneously worked on native projects using React & React-Native (like MRDb - fav & ongoing,COVID tracker,Chathouse v2,etc.) Now I'm learning about Block-chain and soon going to do a project on it. I code/hack for a purpose and fun.",
