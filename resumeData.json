    "bio": "Hi there! I am Aryan! I made my first program (a shutdown virus) in 7th standard and since then I have been in love with coding. I started learning to hack into devices (after watching Mr.Robot :) and since then I have hacked into the main computer of my school ( NO CAP ) and hacked into database of my college too.(I am not a certified hacker though but they don't have proof too so :) Then I got interested in creating native projects using React & React-Native (like MRDb:fav & ongoing,COVID tracker,Chathouse v2,etc.) Now I'm learning about Blockchain and soon going to make huge project on it. I code for fun (it's kinda boring now) and a purpose(not revealed yet).",
